# Base Directory

This directory serves as the storage for the foundational components of the project. It's where the core functionalities and configurations reside.

## Layout

The Layout component is responsible for the overall structure of the application's user interface. It defines how different parts of the application, such as headers, footers, and main content areas, are arranged.

## Router

The Router component manages the navigation between different parts of the application. It interprets the browser's URL and loads the corresponding page or component.

## Mantine

The Mantine component in this project is where we define the `createTheme` and `MantineProvider`. This allows us to customize the look and feel of the application, while `MantineProvider` ensures these customizations are applied throughout the application. This setup enables a consistent and responsive user interface, leveraging Mantine's robust library of pre-designed components.

## Format for Acceptance Criteria

1. **Title**
    - Start with a clear, concise title that summarizes the feature or user story.
1. **Background/Context (Optional)**
    - Provide any necessary background information that helps clarify the feature.
1. **Criteria**
    - List each acceptance criterion as a separate point.
    - Begin each criterion with a verb (e.g., "Display," "Calculate," "Prevent").
1. **Scenarios**
    - Describe specific scenarios in Given/When/Then format.
1. **Notes/Assumptions (Optional)**
    - Include any assumptions or notes that might be relevant.

```
Given [initial context/state],
When [action/event occurs],
Then [expected outcome/result].
```

## Tips for Writing Acceptance Criteria

1. **Be Specific and Clear**
    - Avoid ambiguity. The criteria should be clear enough so that two different people would interpret it in the same way.
1. **Focus on User Experience**
    - Write criteria from the user's perspective. What should the user be able to do? How should the feature work for them?
1. **Keep It Testable**
    - Each criterion should be testable. Avoid subjective terms like "fast" or "easy," which can't be measured precisely.
1. **Independent Criteria**
    - Each criterion should stand on its own and be understandable without requiring additional context.
1. **Include Functional and Non-functional Requirements**
    - Remember to include criteria for both how the feature functions and how it performs (e.g., loading time, response time).
1. **Limit the Number of Criteria**
    - Too many criteria can be overwhelming. Stick to the most critical points that define the feature's completion.
1. **Use Simple Language**
    - Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary. The criteria should be understandable for everyone involved in the project, not just developers.
